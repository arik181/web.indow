<h2 class="text-center">Limited Residential Warranty</h2>

<p>R Value, Inc. doing business as Indow (“Indow”) provides this Limited Residential Warranty to
purchasers who use the product in a non-commercial property, not used for income-generating
purposes (Our Limited Commercial Warranty may be viewed at
<a href="http://go.indowwindows.com/commercial_warranty">http://go.indowwindows.com/commercial_warranty</a>. Indow warrants its window inserts against
defects of materials or workmanship as long as the purchaser owns the property for which the
window insert was purchased. This warranty is not transferrable.</p>

<p><u>Exclusions</u><br>
This warranty does not apply to any Indow window insert which has been subject to accident, acts
of God, fire, flood, abuse or misuse, abuse by harmful fumes, vapors, solvents, chemicals or
chemical pollutants in the atmosphere, mold, building settlement or structural failures of walls or
foundations. We do not warrant our glazing against scratching or breakage which can occur if
improperly handled. We do not warrant our acrylic glazing against clouding, yellowing or loss of
light transmission caused by dirt, scratching, breakage, or improper cleaning with ammonia or
bleach based cleaners.</p>

<p><u>Glazing and Tubing</u><br>
Indow uses only the highest quality materials in the manufacture of our products. Indow warrants
its clear acrylic glazing against a change in light transmission in excess of 3%. This does not cover
certain specialty grades that are not clear to start with (including Blackout, Privacy and Shade
Grades), nor clear acrylic glazing exposed to artificial light sources emitting intense amounts of
UVB or higher energy radiation. The Indow compression tubing is made of silicone which resists
the effects of heat, cold and ultraviolet exposure.</p>

<p><u>Condensation</u><br>
Condensation is not a product defect, but the result of excess humidity. Condensation, frost, or
mold, mildew, or fungus on window surfaces is not covered by the Limited Warranty. Indow bears
no responsibility or liability for any situation where molds or other associated conditions arise as a
result of improper use, cleaning, sealing, humidification or ventilation.</p>

<p><u>Venting</u><br>
Indow does not warrant its window inserts against venting excess air pressure. It is part of an
Indow window insert’s normal function to occasionally relieve excess air pressure by ‘popping’ a
corner or side in response to heavy external winds combined with extreme temperatures or a
blower door test. Simply press the window insert back into place to restore normal function.</p>

<p><u>Window Opening Control Devices</u><br>
Window Opening Control Devices (WOCDs) are not a substitute for careful supervision of children.
WOCDs must be tested at least monthly. Follow all safety information and instructions provided
with WOCDs.</p>

<p>Indow will not pay for any incidental or consequential damages, and its liability under this
warranty, or under any implied warranty, is limited to repairing or replacing (in our sole discretion)
any part or parts of the window insert that are found to be defective under the terms of this
warranty. We will endeavor to supply original replacement parts; however, replacement parts may
differ from the original parts. Warranty repair or replacement of the Indow window insert is free of
charge to you. In the case of improper cleaning, storage or maintenance, Indow will not be held
responsible for any costs incurred in repairing or replacing any product under this warranty
including, but not limited to, transportation costs, costs of removal, disposal, installation or
reinstallation.</p>

<p>Approved care, cleaning and installation instructions are available on the Company’s website at
<a href="http://www.indowwindows.com/care">www.indowwindows.com/care</a>. To make a claim
If you discover a defect of materials or workmanship, please contact Indow. Upon providing proof
of purchase, Indow in its sole discretion, will repair or replace your defective Indow window
insert(s). This limited warranty is effective for products purchased on or after January 1, 2015.</p>
